## Electrolysed edition
This is the electrolyzed edition of UAD. In essence the tool has been rewritten in **Modern Object Pascal** to make it easier for contributions and most of all, design and maintain a nice UI.

There's no better way to remove Rust with electrolysis.

## Getting started with development
- Either download the latest release of the Lazarus IDE which also contains the Free Pascal compiler from the [official website](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/index.php?page=downloads) or use your favorite package manager under Linux or macOS.
- Clone this repository.
- Open the project file located in the the project directory.
- Compile and run - it can't be any easier! - Happy hacking.


**This software is still in an early stage of development. Check out the issues, and [feel free to contribute!](https://github.com/system-detox/universal-android-debloater-next-generation-electrolyzed/wiki/How-to-contribute)**

## Summary

This is a fork of [UAD NG](https://github.com/Universal-Debloater-Alliance/universal-android-debloater-next-generation) project which in turn is a detached fork of the [UAD project](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater), which aims to improve privacy and battery performance by removing unnecessary and obscure system apps.
This can also contribute to improving security by reducing [the attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface). Read the [wiki](https://github.com/system-detox/universal-android-debloater-next-generation-electrolyzed/wiki) for more details on getting started.
